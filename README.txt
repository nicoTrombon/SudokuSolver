SudokuSolver
============
input.csv: a csv file with a representation of a partially filled sudoku with 0s in unfilled spaces.
Eg:

0,3,5,2,9,0,8,6,4
0,8,2,4,1,0,7,0,3
7,6,4,3,8,0,0,9,0
2,1,8,7,3,9,0,4,0
0,0,0,8,0,4,2,3,0
0,4,3,0,5,2,9,7,0
4,0,6,5,7,1,0,0,9
3,5,9,0,2,8,4,1,7
8,0,0,9,0,0,5,2,6

The solver will create a new csv, called output.csv with the solved puzzle in the same format as the input.
Eg:
1,3,5,2,9,7,8,6,4
9,8,2,4,1,6,7,5,3
7,6,4,3,8,5,1,9,2
2,1,8,7,3,9,6,4,5
5,9,7,8,6,4,2,3,1
6,4,3,1,5,2,9,7,8
4,2,6,5,7,1,3,8,9
3,5,9,6,2,8,4,1,7
8,7,1,9,4,3,5,2,6

It is based completely on http://norvig.com/sudoku.html
The only changes are in the puzzles' input and output
